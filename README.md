# Facial-Expression-Recognization

This project was built using keras with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) Here, A wide range of still pictures of the human face expressions has been trained using a sequential model and the recognized image is categorized into five different categories. The developed method can be used in different applications like in marketing areas, surveillance systems. The experimented result was ultimately achieving an accuracy of 0.77 in a five class classification task.
